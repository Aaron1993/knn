# k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

## Requirements:
* GNU Octave

## The Model:
* [k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) using uniform weights.
* Uses L2 norm function to compute distance.
* Selects randomly to break ties.

## Source Files:
* ```knn_classify.m```: contains function to train model and predict labels for evaluation dataset.

## Instructions:
* Call the ```knn_classify``` method with parameters, k, train_data, train_labels, and eval_data.
